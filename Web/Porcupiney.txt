We actually solved this problem by accident while trying to solve the easier problem Deery. We just changed the protocol from http to https on the deery link and Firefox came up with a warning, as shown in the following screenshot<insert ss here>. Then we looked through nonononono.woodlandhighschool.xyz and at the bottom of the page we found the flag.
