Problem:SSS Part1
Solver(s):Gabies#3036

The problem had attached to it a .png file which was showing a linear function and 3 values in the XY coordinate system, also the picture shows a dot at the value of f(0).
The problem statement was the big hint, looking up for Lagrange in cryptography you can read about Lagrange Interpolation and Shamir's Secret Sharing.
So after a good read time it was clear that we were given 3 keys for an SSS which needed only 2 keys.

SO:
S=f(0)
S+X1=K1
S+X2=K2
2*S=K1+K2-X1-X2
S=(K1+K2-X1-X2)/2
Transform S in hexadecimal and the into ascii ant that's the flag.
