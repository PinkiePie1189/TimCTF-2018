Problem:Substitute Teacher
Solver(s):Gabies#3036
In this problem we were given a ciphertext.txt.
The encryption was just a alphabet shuffle for lowercase letters, so when i found a paragraph that was written in uppercase i just copied
it and pasted it in google, i found out soon that the book was The Da Vinci Code. 
for here on it's trivial to find out the inverse encryption permutation of the alphabet and then apply it on the ciphertext.
the just look up for "timctf" and you'll get the flag. (i actuall solved this problem on my phone :) ).
