Problem:Back in Time
Solver(s):Gabies#3036

In this problem we were given a ciphertext and an encryption python script.
The script just applies on the plaintext an alhabet shuffle for lowercase letters.
The ciphertext just contains the encypted flag: hsijhk{Pc3nvO_R4NvwM_1S_Nwh_RArD0M}
.
We can see that some of the words can be deducted: RArD0M-> RAnD0M so r=n; R4NvwM->R4NdoM so v=d and w=o also hsijhk-> timctf.
from all these observations the flag becomes timctf{Pc3ndo_R4NdoM_1S_Not_RAnD0M}.
Looking up for words that look like p*e*do in english we quickly see that the flag is timctf{Ps3udo_R4NdoM_1S_Not_RAnD0M}.
